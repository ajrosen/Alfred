```


### Variables

### Commands

All commands start with ***lp***, so there's only one thing to remember.

-  **lpin [username]**

    Login to LastPass.  The username is taken from the workflow variable {lpuser}, unless specified here.

    After you enter your LastPass password you will be prompted for your MFA code, unless you have previously logged in with the CLI's *--trust* option.
